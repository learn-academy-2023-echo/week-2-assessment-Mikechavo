## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component:
A component is a building block used to create reusable code. There are multiple components like function/stateless and class/stateful.

2. Spread operator:
A feature that provides an easy way to expand elements from iteration. Can be used in two different ways: array spread operator and object spread operator.

3. React state:
A way to manage and maintain data within a component. State allows components that can be changed over time to be tracked. React will automatically re-render the changes of the component.
